# rainfall-prediction
rainfall-prediction is based on Neural Network in python 3.6.9, to predict precipitation in a river delta region like Bangladesh. Rainfall, considered as time series data, is used to develop, simulate, test and improve algorithms and the current model performs 5% better than statistical models.
